**Theme**: Running out of space

**Name**: Lemonade Stand???

**Tagline**: Sell lemonade without causing accidents?

- You will have a lemonade stand.
- It will become popular very quickly.
- Queues will form.
- There are at least two queues, one from each direction (maybe not in the first level).
- You must choose which queue to serve next.
- If a queue is "full", it will queue onto the street instead of the sidewalk.
- If that happens, you have a certain amount of time before the police show up and tell you to
shut down your stand because it creates unsafe situations with people on the street.
- Each level has a goal and a predetermined set of spawns, such that the
difficulty will always be the same for each player.

Wish list:
- Mix the drinks (i.e. sugar, lemonade, water)
- Mood of buyers (i.e. drink composition, wait time, how many people are served before them when choosing sides)
- Friends helping
